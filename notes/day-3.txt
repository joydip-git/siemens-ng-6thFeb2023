1. client-side framework
2. SPA
3. How angular works
		index.html loaded in the browser
		main.ts code executed, which pulls the root module, after a context for angular application is created (PlatformRef)
		Bootstrap component object is created and design is rendered in the index.html 
4. Angular assets:
		a. components
		b. directives
		c. modules
		d. services
		e. pipes
5. Decorator functions: @Component(), @NgModule()
6. declaratiions, imports, providers, bootstrap, exports
7. Angular Feature:
		binding:
		a. code=>view (data binding: interpolation {{}} and property binidng [])
		b. view => code (event binding (event)="method()")
8. Directives:
		a. component directive
		b. structural directive (*ngIf, *ngIfElse, *ngFor, *ngSwitch)
		c. attribute directive (ngClass, ngStyle)

A. service and DI
		i. basics
			  how to create service
				how to consume service (DI)
				@Injectable()
		ii. custom provider
		iii. maintain state using sevice and RxJS
		iv. making HTTP requests
B. Pipe
C. RxJS: Observable, observer, modify observable data using rxjs operators
D. Component lifecycle events and hooks
E. Passing data between nested components


structure:
	app
		app.component.ts
		app.component.html
		app.component.css
		app.component.spec.ts
		app.module.ts
		modules
			albums
				albums.module.ts
				components
					album-list
						album-list.component.ts
						album-list.component.html
						album-list.component.css
				pipes
						
				services

				directives
		
			core


service instance can be depndency injected in 
		another service
		a component
		a directive
		a pipe
		a module

service instance can be registered at
		an asset level
		a feature module level
		root module level

service dependency injection happens through
		a provider
		an injector

by default a token with the same name as that of the service is generated and used for DI
providers:[NameService] <= token with the same name as that of the service is registered

class NameComponent{
constructor(private s:NameService){
 //angular finds a service with the token name 'NameService', then Injector creates the instance of that service and DI it in the ctor
}

HTTP requests:
Built-in service class: HttpClient (@angular/common/http)
		.get<Album[]>(url), .put(), .post(url, data), .patch(), .delete()

import HttpClient from '@angular/common/http' package
ask for DI of HttpClient in you service constructor
Being a built-in service class, it's provider has been configured in a module (bulit-in): HttpClientModule.
you need to import the same module in your module class where you have registered your service, from the same @angular/common/http package

event name interface name method name
X					OnX						ngOnX		
init			OnInit					  ngOnInit
destroy	OnDestroy					ngOnDestroy
